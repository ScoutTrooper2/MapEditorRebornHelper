# Functions
At the moment, the plugin has only one function - adding doors to the game directly through the unity editor.

# Other
I was too lazy to come up with some fancy ideas for implementing compilation through Unity, so everything is done simply through names.
I use this to make buttons-doors instead of pickups, as SCPs can't click on pickups.

# Questions and Answers
Q: Why root_true / parent_true? 
A: Because if you change the parent door to something else, it will break

Q: Why is the event here?
A: Idk, it is good for me.
